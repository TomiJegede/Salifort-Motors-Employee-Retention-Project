# Salifort Motors Employee Turnover Prediction



This project is the final capstone for the Google Advanced Analytics course. The task was to build a model for Salifort Motors to predict if an employee would quit, addressing their high rate of employee turnover.



## Project Overview



Salifort Motors has been experiencing a high rate of employee turnover. The goal of this project was to build a predictive model to identify employees who are likely to quit. The project involves exploratory data analysis, data visualization, and building predictive models using various machine learning techniques.

## Data Analysis



- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** 

  - Checked the data for outliers.

  - Created visualizations to understand the relationships between variables:

    - Histograms

    - Scatterplots

    - Heatmaps



## Modeling



- Built predictive models using:

  - Logistic Regression

  - Decision Tree

  - Random Forest



- The tree-based models outperformed the logistic regression model, with the Decision Tree slightly outperforming the Random Forest.



## Results



- **Decision Tree Model:** Best performing model.

- **Random Forest Model:** Slightly less accurate than the Decision Tree but more robust.

- **Logistic Regression Model:** Outperformed by tree-based models.
